# Classic-Snake-Game-using-Python-Turtle-Graphics
This is a fun, classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. It's a lightweight GUI game that replicates the nostalgic gameplay where the snake grows longer as it eats food, and the player tries to avoid running into the walls or itself.
